* What's that?
  This is a simple web that will give you pieces of cool stuff in
  general, for now it's quotes and optical illusions. You can't get
  them back (easily), and I use it to easily get quotes for mail
  signatures, or when I want to look smart.

  I did to fiddle with [[https://mithril.js.org/][mithril]] and [[https://milligram.io/][milligram]], which are technologies
  I'm not familiar at all. In the end, it's much more painful to
  understand the toolchain and why I needed webpack anyway and node to
  do the development than the coding part. I guess that's why libs that
  free you from the dom (a bit) are so successful.

  The optical illusions are taken from
  https://im-possible.info/english/library/index.html, and the quotes
  are from https://quotebot.raimonster.workers.dev/ (which is a simple
  api to get random quotes from a huge list I keep feeding).
